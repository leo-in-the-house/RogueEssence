        //how do we get additional gen steps added to mapgens?
        //should we have the original mapgen create a runtime copy?
        //with this runtime copy being a list of IGenSteps?

        //problem: if we split gridfloorplan and listfloorplan into separate components
        //logic for adding special rooms will first need to check for grid floor plan
        //and then IF THAT FAILS, to check listfloorplan in order to function
        //in order to prevent adding two steps to the flow,
        //we must check if the first genstep will accept the mapcontext
        //this means that we must process the mapcontext of that floor AFTER IT IS CREATED
        //so for spreading classes, we need:
        //a class for the zone that can divvy up and choose which floors get the special step
        //a class for the mapgen, to check which type of step it needs to be given
        //and the actual gensteps to be placed in the genstep list

        //a prerequisite to this is that there MUST be a way for the gensteps,
        //at least in runtime, to include all forms of IGenStep, not only GenStep<T>

        //alternatively, zonepostprocs can hold state
        //when a new zone is introduced, a copy of the original zonepostprocs
        //are all added to the ZoneContext
        //when the time comes to create a new map,
        //first the gencontext is created for that floor
        //then it is passed into each of the zonecontext members
        //(the gensteps for the floor are currently in a separate list)
        //the zonecontext members will do their job, updating floor counts etc.
        //and they will alter the list of floorgen elements directly

        //how can we make MapGen not couple itself with outside sources,
        //yet allow itself to be modified by them?
        //1. create a runtime class that mapgen instantiates
        //with List<GenPriority<IGenStep>> defined instead of List<GenPriority<GenStep<T>>>
        //this class will actually generate its class
        //however, it needs to be able to give out its map context to be analyzed by contexts first
        //2. modify mapgen.  have it take in a ZoneGenContext
        //which will have its seed needed to generate
        //it will first create the instance of the context,
        //and set up a local List<GenPriority<IGenStep>> variable 
        //the zonecontext members include runtime zonepostprocs
        //that will appreciate a IGenContext + List<GenPriority<IGenStep>> being passed into them
        //then, gensteps will continue on as per usual
        //3. inherit from mapgen. do the above but make it overridden code
        //the base class will put the genstep execution code into its own function
        //a new method will be created that works like the above
        //this new method will need to go in a new IMapGen, however...

        //**is there a way to not alter the list of floorgen elements directly?
        //there doesn't have to.  there is precedent with battle flow priority

        //**in order to prevent searching for specific steps to put the new steps in front of or behind
        //you will need to establish a priority system
        //on the mapgen's list itself, as well as the list held in the zonecontext member
